# Aho Farms Website

**Status:** Pre-launch review
**Hosting:** Vercel

## Local preview

Run `node scripts/dev-server.js`, then open `http://localhost:8123`. The local
server mirrors the site's extensionless public routes, including `/news` and
the article URLs under `/news/`.

## Generated pages and launch checks

After changing shared navigation, portal content or migrated news content, run:

```sh
node scripts/build-portals.js
node scripts/build-news.js
node scripts/propagate-nav.js
node scripts/propagate-chrome.js
node scripts/propagate-launch.js
node scripts/clean-internal-links.js
node scripts/build-sitemap.js
node scripts/check-nav.js
node scripts/check-launch.js
node scripts/audit-site.js
```

Vercel serves clean, extensionless URLs through `cleanUrls` in `vercel.json`.
Legacy launch redirects are version controlled in the same file.

## Temporary search exclusion

`scripts/indexing.js` records four temporarily non-indexable pages: Products,
Consumer Portal, Sun-grown and Kaitiakitanga. Their generated HTML contains
`noindex, follow`; sitemap generation omits them. Routes, navigation and
robots.txt crawl access remain available. This is an indexing request, not
access control or a guarantee of immediate removal from search results.
Run `node scripts/check-indexing.js` after the normal regeneration sequence.

## Analytics (publish container before merge)

See `docs/analytics-readiness.md` for the import JSON and release checks. Run
`node scripts/propagate-analytics.js` after editing `assets/aho-analytics.js`,
then `node scripts/check-analytics.js`, `node scripts/check-gtm.js` and
`node scripts/check-enquiry-tracking.mjs`.
This branch enables default-on public-page analytics with browser opt-out.
Publish its replacement GTM import before merging; leave Enhanced Measurement
on (Site Search off). The standard Google tag sends automatic pageviews and a
guarded email-click event. Contact/Export success events require acceptance by
the mail provider; failures retain entered fields. HubSpot visitor tracking uses
the existing account on the same public pages. Production mail routing, HubSpot
account settings and any CRM form integration still need owner verification.
Local tests mock mail transport and do not prove inbox or CRM receipt. Verify
real receipt/CSP after merge. The earlier
manual page-view import is superseded and its manual tag must remain paused.

## Portals (sign-in, protected routes)

The Portals gateway lives under `/portal/`: a public Consumer Portal
(access pathway, Get Connected lead capture with country-based prescriber partner referral) and three
protected environments (Prescribers, Pharmacies, Export Partners) with
per-portal sign-in, request-access, role-based access and a dashboard
framework. Design and operations:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-portals-auth-design.md`.

`portal-flags.json` controls which portals the public site exposes (at launch:
Consumer Portal only). `node scripts/check-launch.js` verifies no hidden portal
is referenced anywhere public.

Before the portals work on a deployment, set `SESSION_SECRET` (and the
admin / store variables described there) in the Vercel project. Locally,
put them in `.env.local` and run the `aho-site` preview.
